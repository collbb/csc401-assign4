CSC 401: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

25 POINTS								due DEC 08, 2016

1.	Write a Python file containing the following functions. Also turn in the output from testing the functions. All arguments to the functions may be hard-coded.
 a.	Function 1 takes a list of strings as a parameter and returns a list of strings consisting of all the unique strings in the parameter list. For example:
 fun1 ([good, cat, bad, cat])
 returns [good, bad]

 b.	Function 2 an integer and returns whether or not the number is a Perfect Number. This means that the sum of its divisors equal the number. Ask Dr. Rao’s 120 students if you get stuck.

 c.	Function 3 takes an integer and returns a list of all integers less than or equal to this number which are Perfect Numbers.

 d.	Function 4 takes a list of mixed types and returns the number of integers in the list. For example: 
 fun4 ([1, [A, 2], B, 3, C, 4, [D, 5]]) 
 returns the value 5

 e.	Function 5 takes a list of anything and removes the second element of the list. For example:
 fun5 ([A, [A, B], C])
 returns [A, C]

2.	Write a Python class called circle, with an instance variable for the radius and methods to calculate the area and
 circumference of the circle.
